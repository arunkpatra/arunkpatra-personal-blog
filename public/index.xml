      <description>Prologue The Indian way of life is woven with yarns of a multitude of faiths, beliefs and convictions. If the warp of our culture’s fabric is rationale, the weft has to be belief. That fabric is dyed with hues of tradition and rituals, and block printed with rich patterns from Hindu mythology. An extraordinarily rich and complex cultural canvas is the result.
Hindu mythology just like Egyptian, Greek or Norse mythology, plays a very important role in carrying forward human culture.</description>

      <description>Flashback 2005 On a rainy August evening, an arduous four legged late night flight from Chennai, India, to San Antonio, TX USA put me on a completely new journey of my professional life. A journey that gave me opportunities to meet people from almost every culture and country. I saw, observed, heard, listened, experienced and lived an incredibly rich and diverse set of cultures. And those experiences included professionalism, work ethics, food, emotional quotient and the purpose of life from a plethora of perspectives.</description>

  Who are you? So asked Neo Contrary to what many might think, the Information Technology shop floor is not vastly different from a production line of the manufacturing industry. There are stark similarities. Same things in IT as well; sales, marketing, planning, design, processes, technology, products and people who create those products - in this case, software.
It is but natural to think, that in the IT industry as well, there are many different roles that people play in the shop floor.</description>

      <description>Introduction Not every problem can be solved using software, but in today&amp;rsquo;s Digital age, probably every single modern service is being enabled by technology and implemented to a good extent in software.
What is a Product? A product is a physical realization of a business idea. It&amp;rsquo;s a concrete tool that helps solve a problem. Building a successful product, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a product developed using Information Technology/Software or not, is easier said than done.</description>

      <description>The E-Learning and Online Technical Certification Market According to Global Market Insights, the e-Learning market size crossed the USD 200 billion mark in 2019 and is expected to grow at over 8% between 2020 and 2026. This data appears to be pre-Covid19 projections. It&amp;rsquo;s not at all difficult to see that the growth rate of this market is definitely going to go north in the current situations. Its just safe to say for now, that e-learning and online technical certification market is booming and will continue to expand rapidly if not explode altogether.</description>

      <description>Do I know why and if I need Cloud? I recently heard a statement from someone in the IT industry saying &amp;ldquo;We got to do cloud, cloud is everything&amp;rdquo;. When probed why, the answer came in - &amp;ldquo;Arun, you need to update yourself. Don&amp;rsquo;t you know that everybody has adopted it and didn&amp;rsquo;t you see the hype curve?&amp;rdquo;. I repeated politely, &amp;ldquo;Still my question&amp;rdquo;. Pat came the answer, &amp;ldquo;Please talk to the engineering team&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>AS MY stay here at California nears its end, I find myself some time at my disposal to just sit back and look back for a while. I met a very wide array of people here, mostly at the Vikings bar where all these oldie bikers show up. Its an old school American bar, and people are friendly. Some master pool players show up sometimes, and my friend Benjamin helped me pick up the basics of the game.</description>

      <description>I THINK I am a born programmer and will be one for the rest of my life. There are very few other things which give me the same amount of satisfaction. But with gradual passage of time something strange has happened.
With time, the kind of designs that I have started creating - and I don&amp;rsquo;t know how or when it happened - no longer appear to follow any standard design pattern.</description>
