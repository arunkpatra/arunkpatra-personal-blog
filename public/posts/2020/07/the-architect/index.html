  Who are you? So asked Neo Contrary to what many might think, the Information Technology shop floor is not vastly different from a production line of the manufacturing industry.

<h2 id="who-are-you-so-asked-neo">Who are you? So asked Neo</h2>
<p>Contrary to what many might think, the Information Technology shop floor is not vastly different from a production line of the manufacturing industry. There are stark similarities. Same things in IT as well; sales, marketing, planning, design, processes, technology, products and people who create those products - in this case, software.</p>
<p>It is but natural to think, that in the IT industry as well, there are many different roles that people play in the shop floor. I discuss one such role in this article - the role of the Architect. I present some thoughts of my own as well.</p>
<h2 id="gandalf-the-gray">Gandalf the Gray</h2>
<p>
    <img src="https://arunkpatra.io/img/software-architect-gandalf.jpg"  alt="Gandalf"  class="left"  style="float:left; margin-right:15px; margin-top:5px "  />

 Remember Gandalf, old guy with the pointy hat? If that rings any bells, it  also reminds one, of Frodo of the Shire and Aragorn son of Arathorn; all mighty heroes in a great endeavor. But Gandalf, as you might agree, was the master planner, adept at everything. The pitch, the motivation, the planning, the leadership, the tactics, the craft, the wisdom, the expertise with the sword and hand to hand combat. He had it all. He was the single most important character in the endeavor without whom, chances were high that the fellowship would have failed. He was the one true Architect of Middle Earth. J. R. R. Tolkien’s cell phone is unreachable since quite sometime, else I would have given him a call for a discussion on the topic.</p>
<p>So, is a Software Architect(and they go by many names - more on it later) the one who knows everything about building and delivering software? Is the Architect an old grumpy guy with strange semblances with a professor with a minimum of twenty years of IT experience? Far from the truth. Let’s see why.</p>
<h2 id="its-not-the-years-honey-its-the-mileage">It’s not the years honey, it&rsquo;s the mileage</h2>
<p>There is no book ever published, no online or offline course ever offered that can make an Architect out of someone. Now that’s a tall claim! I’m sure, there are a bunch of certifying agencies out there, looking for my blood right now. But that’s ok. Now, all those books and content, can definitely impart certain skills and share some established point of views, but they can only do so much. So how does someone become an architect, what is an architect’s real job and what is an architect’s real value in the modern Information Technology industry? But first a quick aside into human psychology.</p>
<h2 id="dont-go-near-the-fireplace-you-will-hurt-yourself">Don’t go near the fireplace, you will hurt yourself</h2>
<p>Have you ever seen a kid heeding that advice? Well they just might, but in their heart of hearts, they secretly desire to actually touch the fireplace. But why? Well, I guess humans are wired that way. They are curious, and they are still curios even after knowing that curiosity killed the crow. Curiosity actually is the single most important thing for humans as a species.</p>
<p>But as we grow up, our curiosity gives way to different ways of life, character, our unique styles if you will. We do certain things and behave only in certain ways that have been conditioned by society, our workplace and the like. Fact is, no one likes to be told what is good or bad, what one should do and should not. People just hate it. Well we might agree with our boss or the project sponsor, but we really don’t like it too much. A certain kind of skill(which is not found in books usually) is required to sell advice, it’s a subtle art. But beware, advice given for free, especially upfront when someone’s tail is not on fire yet, is usually ignored. Let it be the software developer, the project manager, the sponsor or the customer. That subtle art, backed by breadth and depth of knowledge, honed by empathy, polished by rational and perfected with professionalism is the most important skill of an architect.</p>
<p>A developer starts with a computer, codes a few simple programs, moves into designing and coding yet more complex programs. Soon, that leads to designing larger and larger systems. That gives way to making long lasting decisions that can make or break an entire organization. And a stage comes when that young coder turns into a master planner, who sees the entire technology world and business world as one large continuous canvas. He/she has the onerous responsibility and the power of making decisions that can change human lives. That is the path an architect’s life traces. Each of these stages is built upon the previous one, brick upon brick. There can never be a roof without the walls. No wall without a foundation. Each stage creates wisdom and learning. And it’s really hard to disseminate that wisdom to anyone and everyone in a way that makes sense for them. And this is one of the most important jobs and duties of a successful architect - communication.</p>
<h2 id="communication-is-key">Communication is key</h2>
<p>Communication is not just transmission of words over sound waves. It’s not what we have to say, or what we say. It’s all about how the listener on the other end perceives. Did it have the intended effect? Was it convincing? Was it backed by facts, presented coherently and explained to an extent that was needed? Lectures, architectural diagrams, documents, flow charts and presentations are meaningless if the listener or the reader was not convinced.</p>
<p>I know an eight year old kid who once showed up at a lecture on the Theory of Relativity and asked so profound a question, that the professor was compelled to come running to the parking lot looking for the kid. In the IT industry also, different stakeholders understand remarkably different languages, have remarkably different backgrounds and remarkably different attention spans. It’s an architect’s job to ensure that he/she has the skills to deal with all of them successfully.</p>
<h2 id="looking-into-the-crystal-ball">Looking into the crystal ball</h2>
<p>One can truly understand the present if one knows what has come to pass. The ability of looking into the future, is the next level of mastery which an architect aspires to acquire. What is going to be the result of a choice we make today? How will technology evolve, and more importantly how market dynamics and consumer sentiments will shape the nature of businesses, business models and hence the fabric of technology solutions. One can’t truly claim to be an architect who can not see into the future of a project or product. Sometimes that deep gaze of the architect must peer through a decade into the future. Needless to say, the right way to acquire such telescopic vision is constant learning, not just technology learning but everything that has a bearing on end users of a technology backed service, people who build those services/products and the way today’s business world runs.</p>
<h2 id="technology-is-commodity-rationale-is-not">Technology is commodity, rationale is not</h2>
<p>The technology world, especially software is evolving so fast that no institute of higher education in Information Technology can keep pace. In my opinion, it’s the fundamentals of computing, clarity of thought, decision making process, creativity and nurturing of ideas that must be focussed upon, in educational institutions. In my opinion, an educational institution offering courses on Information Technology and teaching Java, HTML, Javascript, PL/SQL, Cloud and Big Data is doing a grave injustice to students and to the society. An active encouragement to become bold adventures, passionate learners and creative thinkers will do sustainable good to the society.</p>
<p>A deeper focus on driving decisions based on rational thinking and argued based on wisdom is probably the real job of an architect. It’s hard work for an architect to acquire such skills. It needs excellent mentors and a voracious appetite of reading.</p>
<h2 id="the-classifications-and-the-jargon">The classifications and the jargon</h2>
<p>There are so many different areas of specialization and classifications for architects. It’s good to know but then the world wide web is your better source of information. But suffice is to say, the enterprise architect, the solution architect, the technical architect, the application architect, the information architect, the data architect and the security architect are all real and valid roles with varying degrees of focus on different areas. But the cross cutting concern remains, rationale thinking, exemplary communication skills, deep understanding of human dynamics, an expansive breadth of knowledge and an insatiable desire of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>If one aspires to choose an architect’s profession, I would say, it’s a rewarding and humbling experience at the same time. It’s a very important role which rolls up leadership, knowledge, humility, curiosity and empathy into one single role - the role of an Architect.</p>
