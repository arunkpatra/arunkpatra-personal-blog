      </h1>

      

      <div class="post-content">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Not every problem can be solved using software, but in today&rsquo;s Digital age, probably every single modern service is
being enabled by technology and implemented to a good extent in software.</p>
<p>What is a Product? A product is a physical realization of a business idea. It&rsquo;s a concrete tool that helps solve a
problem. Building a successful product, whether it&rsquo;s a product developed using Information Technology/Software or not,
is easier said than done. According to studies, around 70 - 90% new products fail. The percentage goes as high as 95%
in some cases.</p>
<p>In this article, we discuss, what I think, could be done to increase our chances of success while building new software
powered products. Specifically, I focus on how to <em>build an ace product development team that&rsquo;s second to none</em>. But first,
let&rsquo;s warm up a bit, just a bit, and then we cut to the chase.</p>
<h2 id="the-a-team---whats-the-motivation">The A++ Team - What&rsquo;s the motivation?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the business idea, the novelty factor, the target market, the sales and marketing plan, the
million/billion dollar funding, the sleek design, or the cool UI. None of these alone can ever guarantee success of a
product. It&rsquo;s a combination of many of these ingredients and many more ingredients that can make the secret sauce for
success. One of those key ingredients is the <em>Team</em>. And the team needs just one single thing to start in a 100%
supercharged way. That thing is called &ldquo;belief&rdquo;. (And believe me - because its almost unbelievable - it&rsquo;s not just the
technical skills that one needs to be successful and create awesome things.) They need to believe that, they are the
ones who would be changing the world with the product they build. If the team does not &ldquo;believe&rdquo; 100% in the idea, if
they are not sold into it and don&rsquo;t relate to it at a level beyond renumeration, chances are high you are never going
to build your A++ team. The investor/sponsor funds the project if he/she believes that he/she can make money. The team
builds the best of the best when they believe that it&rsquo;s their own baby and then it becomes a labor of love. How many of
you would agree? Please let me know in the comments.</p>
<h2 id="the-method-to-the-madness">The Method to the Madness</h2>
<p>Software product development is part science and part art. There are specific job titles available for people who are
skilled in the art of software product development. But believe me or not, you probably don&rsquo;t need any of those
experts(they might help a lot though and one should use them by all means). All that you need is the sponsor&rsquo;s skin in
the game, a compelling business case, a market to sell, a clear head to think, a methodical approach,
immense-immense-immense focus, a supercharged team, transparency, clear communications and an unassailable desire to
succeed.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s cut to the chase and focus on how do we create the A++ product development dream team of ours.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-build-a-team---the-first-team-member">What do I need to Build a Team - The first Team Member</h2>
<p>So you want your A++ team hunh? What do you need to start? People obviously. Isn&rsquo;t it? Wrong. Not just any people. We
need the sharpest and the brightest. Wrong again. Ok, we need the MIT undergrad and the Wharton MBA(I have the greatest
respect for MIT, Wharton and the incredibly amazing people over there). Wrong again. Ok, we need the &ldquo;Product Manager&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Product Design Head&rdquo; from the XYZ company with 15 years of experience. Wrong again. Ok, a task master who can
get things done. Wrong. Ok then, we need change agents, disruptors, transformation champions, rainmakers!
Ok, I give up&hellip;</p>
<p>You need, a leader to start with - and leader is not a designation. You need someone who has lived life in a pretty
wholesome way. Someone who has seen some hardships in life, dejections, failures and successes and has tons of common
sense and ready wit. You need someone, well travelled, well read(not just technical qualification, programming
languages, frameworks, agile, scrum, cloud services and the latest and greatest from the silicon valley). You need
someone who doesn&rsquo;t hesitate to laugh and cry with someone totally unknown. Someone who is a great human being, a
common man/woman with a huge heart. A good speaker, but an even better listener. Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what you need to
start building your A++ software development team(No, I didn&rsquo;t have an overdose of those The Expendables movies during
the lockdown - I&rsquo;m talking for real, from my own experiences). There are a few other nice to have qualities of this
person, but that&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-team---further">Building your Team - Further</h2>
<p>Ok, now you hired the leader. Remember you(the sponsor) hired him/her. Now trust him/her. Give him/her the freedom,
the freedom to build the team they see fit. Enable and empower the leader with all the right tools and resources.
These tools and resources also include mentoring and coaching as the need may be. You as a leader of the leader now
needs to take a backseat, kind of always there in the background but not hovering like a chopper either. You are the
leader&rsquo;s safety net, you are the Plan B.</p>
<p>Now, comes the good stuff. The team. Should I hire just anyone? Well, it depends. Your needs of product development
might require some unique skills in specific technologies or specific arts. You absolutely need to look for them. A
carpenter possibly can&rsquo;t be hired to do the job of a graphic designer. But if a carpenter does apply for the job, who
produces the world&rsquo;s most beautiful, simplest and most functional chairs, I can guarantee you, you would benefit from
giving the carpenter a long hard look. It would be worth the effort. In essence, it&rsquo;s not just what someone knows, but
what someone can learn and is bringing in. How creative is the person, how positive someone&rsquo;s attitude towards life is.
How far one is ready to go to achieve success and what is the very meaning of success for that person. If you think,
that this person can change the world along with you, you got your A+++ player(Just like in the movie Kungfu Panda. A
big fat panda can become THE big fat panda - the Dragon Warrior. All that is needed is belief, just as Master Oogway
said and Master Shifu believed). Remember, you yourself are a A++ player. Just about anyone with the right coaching,
right mentoring and right tools can become an A player - they just need to believe in themselves. It must become a part
of their psychology, &ldquo;What one man/woman can do, another definitely can&rdquo;. I am definitely not saying that one can
become Steve Jobs or Elon Musk - one doesn&rsquo;t need to. But one can definitely change the world in even better ways than
Steve and Elon.</p>
<p>A more grounded reality is however, go for the very best talent that you think that works for you. Keep an eye on the
timelines of your project - you get my drift. And yes, one more thing. The more diverse the team is, the better.
Diversity in terms of language, culture, demography, sexual orientation, color, political inclination just helps, not
hurts. You are the best decider for yourself based on real project needs on the ground.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-guns-the-ammo---the-tools">The Big Guns, the Ammo - The Tools</h2>
<p>Ok, the motivation from the sponsor, the true leader and a team that believes, have now been hired. We need something
else. We don&rsquo;t go out fighting a tactical war against a sophisticated adversary with primitive, crude weapons with belief
bursting out of our hearts. That would be suicide. We need the right tools. You as a leader, got to enable your
software product development team with the right tools. But even before that, talk to the team, understand how they do
what they do. Observe, just don&rsquo;t speak, observe from a distance - as if you are the learner. Over time, you would know
what problems they face, practical problems. Now go hunting for tools. The very best
IDE(Integrated Development Environment), the very best collaboration tools, the very best automation tools, the
largest box the developers need to run the CI builds, the most robust and most stable tools if you will. So, that the
team can just code, and code happily. Do not, I repeat, do not cut corners with the developers and their tools. Listen
to every demand(whether you understand fully or not) and take your time to understand first and then decide on the
investment. Tools are the very first enablers of success for your A Team.</p>
<h2 id="the-clarity-the-plan-the-open-lines-of-communication">The Clarity, The Plan, The Open Lines of Communication</h2>
<p>Nobody wants a haphazard plan. Nobody likes a moving target to chase. But honestly if it&rsquo;s a moving target after all,
at least everyone in the team must know and be prepared for that. You can call it agility or whatever you like, but you
just can&rsquo;t assume that everyone is fine with your demands. The team must be an equal shareholder in every decision that
is made in the team from day zero.</p>
<p>Over time, and after the initial hustle and bustle and whirlwind activity, you will see patterns evolving in the team.
You as a leader will become richer as well in your own thought process. You will be able to sharpen the plan. Don&rsquo;t
forget the sponsor either, he/she also needs to be a part of the communication chain. Oh please, I am not talking about
status reports - they are so passé. I am talking of enabling the sponsor with the right tools so that he/she can become
an extension to the development team. Yes its possible with today&rsquo;s modern tools.</p>
<h2 id="of-plans-gone-wrong-of-humans-of-empathy-of-fear-and-hope">Of Plans Gone Wrong, Of Humans, Of Empathy, Of Fear and Hope</h2>
<p>I am a human being. I have so many different organs in my body. When a specific organ is not so well, I take extra care
of it, I see a doctor and the like. I do that voluntarily. Why should it be any different with your software product
development team? Didn&rsquo;t they sign up with you and bought your pitch that they are going to change the world? You
filled their minds with dreams, hope and ambition. Now is the time to fulfill your oaths as a leader. And there is no
better time to prove yourself as a leader than when things go wrong, horribly wrong. Here&rsquo;s the leader&rsquo;s golden chance
to use this very difficult moment to strengthen the team even more - from within. Sweet! You do this as a leader,
leading by example, by sharing the load, by taking the bullet for your team, by doubling down on your own efforts.
You, lead in the true sense. You become more creative, get all the help you can from others, and make that help
available to the team. You introspect, listen more and replan as needed. Sometimes, you take a short pause and go
hang out at the bar or see a football game with the team.</p>
<h2 id="concrete-plans">Concrete Plans</h2>
<p>Think deep, look into the future, plan big, but start small. Baby steps are always good, a 100 day plan is excellent.
Foster a culture of refactoring code, reinventing and readjusting as needed. It should become second nature, all made
easy by the use of tools. Convince your team, that there&rsquo;s no such thing called bad decisions or bad code, its just
that they did not see everything coming. Show them what happens if code is written in a particular way and what impact
it has on the success chances of a project. Believe me, all the great individuals you hired in the team, will overnight
clean up the code and make it better, much much better.</p>
<p>So, plan well, get the buy-in from the sponsor, get it signed off by the developers as well, and move with confidence,
without the fear of failure. Failure is just another name for experience. But life is short, and we don&rsquo;t have the time
to commit all the mistakes ourselves. So learn from other&rsquo;s mistakes. We got a 100 day plan, remember?</p>
<h2 id="a-note-to-the-product-developer">A Note to The Product Developer</h2>
<p>I myself, as a developer know that, it always helps to work incrementally. Commit your code often, maintain a code
coverage of greater than 80%, document your code as if you are waxing your new car, be fair with your fellow
developers, not only help, but find opportunities to help your fellow team members. Automate, automate and automate.
Use tools to communicate, collaborate and share. Replace any and every repetitive task with an automated process.
Believe me, you will code with joy. You will have more spare time. You will love to code, and you will see the most
awesome product shaping up - right in front of your eyes. You will have the best and most memorable time of your
lives - and you will not even regret if we fail. Success will follow.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h2>
<p>A successful product development team can be built - it&rsquo;s hard, but it can be done. What&rsquo;s needed is the business case,
the market, right motivation, the right mindset, an understanding of human dynamics, tools and a lot of common sense.
I have failed more often than have I succeeded. But with each failure, and after working with each individual, my
team&rsquo;s success rate and hence my own success rate, has just increased. And it has happened by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>I think, I am looking at the next great leader and successful product development team - I am looking at you.</p>
