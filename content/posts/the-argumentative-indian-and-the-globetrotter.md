## Flashback 2005

On a rainy August evening, an arduous four legged late night flight from Chennai, India, to San Antonio, TX USA put me on a completely new journey of my professional life. A journey that gave me opportunities to meet people from almost every culture and country. I saw, observed, heard, listened, experienced and lived an incredibly rich and diverse set of cultures. And those experiences included professionalism, work ethics, food, emotional quotient and the purpose of life from a plethora of perspectives. There's a little bit of everything I brought back home finally in 2012, and settled down at my new workplace in Bangalore among a league of extraordinary gentlemen and inspiring ladies. 

This article is what I learnt about conducting oneself in a business environment, especially in the Information technology industry. I juxtapose those learnings against Indian values and the Indian way of life. I present my thoughts on how I should conduct myself at a place of business given my unique background as an Indian and as a professional - all in the context of a IT organizational setup. Wanna grab a tall coffee? Medium is just fine as well.

## The People I Met, And The Little Things They Do

My work took me to some of the most powerful business houses and corporations in the world across the Americas. Largely American companies predominantly with American leadership, work ethics but with a growing percentage of Indians. I saw among many other things at the workplace, how people actually work. A task group leader is invariably someone who is fully aware of all the production processes which produce something from the production line - both software and machinery. That leader is ultimately accountable for the finished goods, its quality and its shipping date. One hand to shake and one neck to choke. The task group leader is a real and concrete role that is only donned by an expert, a leader and a very very capable worker who has usually risen up the ranks doing what his/her team currently does. It was a unique thing I saw, and it is different from other cultures and countries especially India - more on it later. But first a quick aside, into the Indian way of life in general.

## Of India, Of Indians And The Indian Way of Life

Undoubtedly, India is one of the oldest and still surviving civilizations today. Over millennia, the Indian way of life has exhibited compassion, respect for diversity, richness of thought and an expansive world view. The very fact that we have close to twenty five different languages (and thousands of unique dialects) in as many states in the country is indicative of our maturity towards diversity. We have absolutely no problems with a different way of life from our own. It's been like that since millennia. 

We have our own little ways of doing things, e.g. we are compassionate in our responses, we are elaborate in our rituals, we are very very accommodating with anyone and everyone. Sometimes, that accommodating outlook is seen as too submissive, too docile and too weak and outrightly 'un-professional' according to certain standards foreign to our culture. But anyway, suffice is to say, there is usually a very deep and far more involved reason as why Indians do those little things - both at the workplace and beyond.

## Doing Business With The West

Most of IT services exported out of India is to the west and western cultures. All these cultures have their own little nuances. The French and the Dutch have their own ways of doing things like greeting someone, attending a meeting, making a point etc. The Britons and Aussies and the Americans are unique in their own ways as well. But what about Indians? Oh yeah! We gel well with everyone - we are like sugar that is soluble in any liquid, be it milk, water etc. But there might be a problem there. You just don't put sugar in anything and everything. Sometimes sugar is just not the thing to add. Sometimes, the unique identity of the Indian which is definitive of the Indian culture is just totally missing in a business context - and I am not even going into uniqueness of the Japanese culture. The biggest problem is that, we many a time, get things mixed up, sometimes pretty horribly - as regards our business and work etiquettes in an IT services context. I think, we have warmed up and we can cut to the chase.

## Of Meetings, Of Phone Calls, Of Calendars, Of Emails

The IT "Service" Industry. One should really try and understand, what we mean by service, whom are we serving(not by name, but by culture). Sometimes the meaning of "service" gets downgraded to such low levels that, "yes sir", "I will get it done", "no problem", "we will fix it" becomes staple. So staple, that it actually looks like fodder or should is say farrago?

When I talk of meetings, there's much to learn from the west. It's just plain dis-respectful to slap a meeting on someone's calendar without any heads-up, without any agenda and without any breathing space. The explanation that "we got a burning situation" is so common that it sounds lame and pretty stupid. Who created the fire? Definitely not me? For me, definitely that fire is not as important as my kids and wife! It's my choice what I do with my time and someone even having the slightest amount of disrespect for that, is probably being totally out of line. We also have a tendency of self-inviting to meetings. It's like a mark of respect to call someone's superior to a meeting without that person neither having a takeaway nor an input to provide - sounds like plain sycophancy to me. Why am I even in this meeting? Shouldn't have I just declined me? Oh my Indian culture! What would the customer think? What would my boss think? I must join this midnight call - my boss and the customer will be happy. Okay! Fact is, they are not - definitely not your professional customer. They are probably intrigued at your "yes sir" behavior at everything - it's beyond their comprehension.

CC's or email carbon copies! It's probably one of the single most abused and misunderstood things in modern business culture. We Indian's have done our part to ruin it further. CC is not meant to appease a boss, it's not meant to threaten someone. It's meant to keep someone informed only when it's important(and the CC'd person actually needs that piece of information) for someone. Your American counterpart will probably be upset with too many emails which don't even need any attention from him/her - it's just distracting them.

Phone calls! What's the time right now? Can't it wait? Whom am I calling? I can call my mommy anytime. My mommy can call me anytime. Are you my mommy? I got only one, and I am sure about that. If I can't respect someone's personal time, that's just plain disrespectful. Plan better. If it's an emergency, text. Don't barge in. The one you are calling has probably never sold his/her personal time/life for a salary. BTW, why do I even have the need of those uncomfortable silences in a call? How do I make the phone call as pleasant as possible? "Hey Billy, how are the Spurs doing?". Billy is my customer, from San Antonio, TX, a great NBA fan and has very good taste in beer. I have never met him personally but we both have a level of respect for each other that's way beyond work.

Calendars! Am I considerate of the fact that someone has back to back meetings? How much breathing space actually one need? Did you check their vacation plan before slapping that meeting on their calendar? What's their work hours? It's just plain disrespectful and outrightly dumb to pollute someone's calendar with inconsiderate requests. Instead, plan better.

Of emails! Whom I am emailing? My boss, my CEO, my colleague, a customer, a vendor or my mom? Do I know his/her culture? Do I know how do they perceive my salutation and way of discussing the topic which I conveyed in the email. The Britons are profoundly distinct from the Americans as regards professional verbiage. The Japanese are extremely unique too. Was I considerate of their culture and especially considerate of him/her as a person. Have I invested time and effort to know cultures and people? I'm not talking of "eloquent english" in emails - that's not even the point. But you get my drift.

## A Lot To Learn, A Lot To Give

We Indian's are unique in our ways of doing things, and it takes much much more than a few pages to present that. A couple books are also not enough. But I am not defending some of our sloppy ways of doing things when looked through a western lens. I personally have tried spreading awareness of Indian culture, Indian values and Indian history with almost all my western friends(most are also my customers). They are genuinely amazed and are so eager to know more. They tend to develop a remarkable amount of respect for us. Isn't it also just right for us Indians to do business with them (and hence with our own colleagues in India) in a way that they will truly appreciate? Shouldn't we learn?

## Conclusion

I have been extremely fortunate to have landed up in a league of extraordinary gentlemen and inspiring ladies that I talked about earlier. My ex-boss and a great leader, lived, professed and taught by example as how to conduct business - and it starts with your own team in India. The small things(which go a long way), letting someone know that you are late to a meeting, letting people know upfront why you had to call so late, explaining someone why are they not needed in a meeting, the "reassuring" way of saying "NO" are something that I got to learn, right here in India and from Indians. My American friends and America embraced me into their culture and I never had the need of becoming an American (fake accent included). I think, I got a lot from everyone, and I gave back as well. Would you think if everybody starts putting in a bit more effort, the Indian service industry's offshore workplaces would become even more enjoyable? Let me know. And, thanks for reading!
