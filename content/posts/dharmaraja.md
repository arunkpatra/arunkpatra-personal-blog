## Prologue

_The Indian way of life is woven with yarns of a multitude of faiths, beliefs and convictions. If the warp of our culture’s fabric is rationale, the weft has to be belief. That fabric is dyed with hues of tradition and rituals, and printed with rich printing blocks from Hindu mythology. An extraordinarily rich and complex cultural canvas is the result._

_Hindu mythology just like Egyptian, Greek or Norse mythology, plays a very important role in carrying forward human culture. It’s not only a way of preserving what has come to pass, but also a great source of inspiration and knowledge for the present and future. While the root word of mythology is myth, mythology itself is probably not just myth. Even if it were, isn’t it just beautiful?_ 

_In Hindu mythology, Dharmarāja, Yamarāja or Yamā, is the God of Justice. He is also the God of death. He is the ultimate judge of the ultimate court and has the responsibility of handing down judgement based on our deeds. He is the keeper of the celestial laws. His purview of justice encompasses everything, the known and the unknown._

_So, enjoy this little story from the past, way, way before you and I were here…_

## The weeping child

The infant wailed on a stormy August evening. Her elder sister tired of hunger, just slept off when she could bear it no more. Beside her, lied their mother, holding on to the last remaining breaths of life she had, waiting for the yamādootā. The father had succumbed to illness last summer, leaving the family in abject poverty and despair.

## Go at once, said Yamā 

In Yamalokā, Yamā’s abode, the lord ordered the yamadootā. “Go at once, and return promptly with her soul. It’s just about time”. The yamadootā appeared magically at the woman’s doorstep in a while. The kid wailed. But something happened that had never happened to the yamadootā. He was overwhelmed with the misfortune and pain of the two young girls he saw. “I can’t take the mother away. These fatherless children won’t possibly survive without their mother. No I can’t take this woman’s soul”. And the yamadootā returned to Yamalokā empty handed. 

“Where is her soul?”, thundered Yamā. “Oh Lord, I could not bring her soul.” Said the yamadootā shuddering with fear. Yamā was not convinced with his account and said, “Yamadootā, your job was to carry out orders. A living beings life is governed by the laws of nature and God’s will. Death is the ultimate truth, and I am the keeper of that ultimate truth. You have not only failed in your duty, but also have disobeyed God’s will. You have interfered with the laws of nature. You will have to atone for your sins. You are hereby relieved of all your heavenly duties and powers. You are expelled from yamalokā and will go to mrityulokā at this very moment. There, you will live the life of a mortal. Your penance will be over when you truly understand why I am expelling you from yamalokā at the first place. Until then you must suffer all the pangs of mortality in mrityulokā.

## The cobbler’s son 

The yamadootā, found himself in the much familiar environs of earth where he had travelled numerous times to ferry souls. In that wintery night, he now shivered beneath a tamarind tree near a cobbler’s hut. The cobbler had been to the market to buy a woolen blanket for his son, for the weather was unbearably chilly. As he passed his hut, blanket in hand, the cobbler saw a man shivering in that chilly night. Taking pity on this unfortunate, homeless man, he gave away the blanket. Hearing this, the cobbler’s wife shouted with rage. “You have no brains, and have no love for my son. How is he going to sleep in this chilly night?” The cobbler could not argue much, and went to sleep.

## The king’s shoes

The yamadootā, now the hungry, homeless man in mrityulokā, took refuge in the cobbler’s house the next day. He slept beside the dog, and he and the dog ate happily whatever leftovers were thrown out everyday. And the homeless man observed from a distance, as the cobbler went about his business making shoes. Everyday, he learnt a knew thing about shoe making. And once when the cobbler was down with fever, much to his amazement, the homeless man had made a pair of unbelievably beautiful shoes. The homeless man became the cobbler’s apprentice. That night, he slept inside a small room and not with the dog. 

Word spread far and near, of a cobbler who sells exquisitely beautiful shoes never before seen in the kingdom.

Many moons passed. One morning, the apprentice was making a pair of slippers, and not fancy shoes. Simple slippers, that were fit for regular use; the kind of slippers, that was customary to be slipped onto the feet of the dead when they are put on the pyre. So the apprentice recalled from his soul ferrying days of the yamadootā. Suddenly a loud knocking on the door was heard. The king’s servants had arrived. “We want the most beautiful shoes in your inventory for the King. Bring them at once”.  The apprentice said, “My lord, all my shoes are sold. I’m making a new pair of slippers today and its almost done. Please take these slippers instead of the shoes you are looking for”. “Are you out of your mind? You will be at once taken prisoner and will be produced at the royal court”, the king’s servant thundered. Just then, a soldier on horseback arrived at the cobbler’s house. He whispered something in the royal servant’s ears. The soldier and the king’s servants left in a hurry - for the king was dead. They however, forgot to take the “dead men slippers” which the apprentice had now almost finished.

## The rich merchant’s daughters’ wedding

Sixteen summers came to pass. There was a wedding. The rich merchant’s daughters were getting married and the cobbler was asked to produce the most exquisite collection of shoes for them. Twenty pairs each were made for the two daughters, Sukanyā and Annapoornā. The shoes were more beautiful than the rainbow and nothing like them had been seen in the entire kingdom ever, for the apprentice put his heart and soul in them, as if those were the last pairs he was making - for someone special. 

The wedding day neared and the cobbler asked the apprentice to deliver the shoes. On the wedding day, the apprentice arrived at the merchant’s house. The merchant’s beautiful daughters Sukanyā and Annapoornā were overjoyed to get such lovely shoes. But the apprentice had a strange feeling. He couldn’t say what it was, but a feeling of déjà vu overtook him. When the daughters were alone, the apprentice asked, “For some strange reasons, it felt like I know you both”. The elder one said, “Oh cobbler, we are not from here. We were orphans. The kind hearted merchant and his childless wife had adopted us sixteen years ago when our mother died”.

The apprentice felt a strange chill up his spine, as if his soul was leaving his body. He could no longer hear the drumbeats of the arriving bridegroom’s marriage party. His eyes blurred and he faded into oblivion.

“Welcome back to Yamalokā yamadootā!”, said Yamā. “Your penance is over, for you now have truly understood the purpose of God’s will and the reason I had banished you from yamalokā.” The yamadootā nodded in agreement at Dharmarāja’s feet.
