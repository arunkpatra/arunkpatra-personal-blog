I THINK I am a born programmer and will be one for the rest of my life. There are very few other things which give me the same amount of satisfaction. But with gradual passage of time something strange has happened.

With time, the kind of designs that I have started creating - and I don't know how or when it happened - no longer appear to follow any standard design pattern. Maybe it is reflective of my own inner self in some way. My designs and models have started taking some strange forms. On a very first look it would appear to the beholder, that below a certain level in the graph, the objects are some in-explicable piece of code which does not say anything. What possible relation could it have with the final objective? They appear to perform some outlandish activity which seemingly is totally unnecessary. What can be achieved in a direct fashion, need not be so abstract after all! We will analyze this, but a bit later...

Another thing that I see, that the designs have become secretive. Its all hidden under layers and layers of objects about which someone would never get a glimpse of. Why have I started giving the user a singe and absolutely single view of the functionality? Why has it become so generic? At first sight this looks horribly wrong somewhere. But this is not my intent. To counter this problem, I have started giving the user every possible means of talking to me and explaining me what exactly he or she wants! What do I mean? Well, I teach the user a language, and the user just needs to talk to me in that language and tell me what they want. It could be as little or as much of information. If i do not understand what they are saying I don't take any action. But if they do talk the same language and say something that I(read it as the design, the model, and the code) understand, their every request is honored and processed. This gives me power to cater to a very wide kind of users, with their own kind of needs which might be very specific. But they all go through the same gates and must talk the language that I understand. That's just the single limitation.

I have also started resorting to going to extreme lengths to keep things virtually unknown to others. The designs have started evolving in such a way that even objects close to each other would not know what is their relation. Somehow I have started putting in place a master controller who sees everything, watches everything and finds out on its own which switch to press and in what order. Maybe I am coming closer and closer to granting all possible power to the controller. I am trying to give it a mind of its own while the lesser mortals are just pawns which dance to the tunes of the controller? Why? Does it need to be like that?

Yet another something. The designs now seem to try to discover unsaid things all the time. They first make an assumption, and then try to find out if that is valid. Did the user ever indicate something like that? It is not necessary that the user was exact or not, as long as something was said in the language the design understands. If yes, the design now tries to verify the validity first. Does it violate any other aspect of the process? If not, I go ahead and fulfill that request...

Coming back to the original question on the abstraction and need for it... To be honest, I hate it and I love it... Nothing more am I capable of saying - inexplicable.
