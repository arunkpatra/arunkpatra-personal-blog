## The E-Learning and Online Technical Certification Market

According to Global Market Insights, the e-Learning market size crossed the USD 200 billion mark in 2019 and is 
expected to grow at over 8% between 2020 and 2026. This data appears to be pre-Covid19 projections. It's not at all 
difficult to see that the growth rate of this market is definitely going to go north in the current situations. Its 
just safe to say for now, that e-learning and online technical certification market is booming and will continue to 
expand rapidly if not explode altogether.

## What is learning, and what should it mean in the true sense?

Learning is the acquisition of the art, some form of skill which enables us to do something useful, e.g. earn a living, 
defeat an adversary etc. Another definition could be, "learning is transfer of experience from the teacher to the 
student". Over millennia, learning has also become a burgeoning business. In ancient India, this business involved a 
one time fee known as "guru-dakshina" that was payable to the teacher by the student upon demand, any time after 
graduation from the institute. The condition however was that, the teacher was entitled to ask any "guru-dakshina" 
they saw fit. The demand of payment could not be countered or negotiated in any way whatsoever and non-payment was a 
severe offense and actually unheard of in ancient India. The "guru" or the teacher was more powerful than the king of 
the land and had complete immunity from any prosecution from the government. The model worked for millennia and by 
around 1000 AD, India was the most advanced country in the world according to all known and recorded history - in the 
field of fundamental sciences, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, government and governance, accounting practices, 
warfare, spiritualism, art, literature and music. India had the lion's share of the global economy. In essence, the 
education system was a proven model that was a major contributor to India's success story till around 1000 AD. So, is 
it safe to say that, education itself, the purpose of education, and the way education is imparted should never ever 
be put into the hands of "just business, driven by the only goal of capital generation in open markets"? I would let 
you decide for yourself. I however believe, societies and civilizations where the true meaning of education is 
understood, and teachers/learning institutions are given the highest respect, are the ones which produce sustainable 
development and growth of the human race.

## Modern Education Systems

Evolution is the law of nature. The weak perish, the best genes survive and multiply and move ahead. However this does 
not mean that the human race or for that matter any species, just becomes better and better. It is well documented in 
the literature that all advanced civilizations have a tendency to self-destruct. Why this happens, is not the matter 
of discussion in this article. So, moving on. The objective of education also has changed over time. From survival and 
the pursuit of art, it has graduated to different forms like developing weapons of mass destruction. Yet another goal 
is to transfer dollars, sometimes unthinkable large amounts of monies from a student's pocket to a businessman's pocket 
who is not even remotely concerned about the meaning of education and all the stuff we talked about in the prior 
sections of this post. But anyway, modern education systems and education delivery media and the business of education 
have successfully worked till modern times. I fancy thinking, that timeframe to be somewhere around the turn of this 
century? More and more people got educated and created wonderful things for mankind, our health improved, flow of money 
became better and the like. Life was good.

## The Start Of The Degenerative Phase

The degeneration of the education system was a global phenomenon. There was no country in the modern(capitalist) world 
that remained untouched - or should I say, the virus with no name just spread without a cure. Population exploded, and 
so did the education market. Aahaa! Here's is a market that is screaming out to be mined! So where there is nectar, 
can the honey bee be far behind. These honey bees came in droves, wearing expensive suits, and ties(I also have suits 
and ties that I use occasionally depending on the need) and opened up shop. Educational institutions mushroomed - they 
promised jobs too. The financial markets lined up their sharpest salesmen to dole out large student loans - without 
even thinking twice. I was appalled to see a student pursuing medicine in Louisville, KY who had taken a $80,000 
student loan. One evening I sat with him and asked, "have you done the math"? He said, "I don't care much... I will pay 
it out over time. And even if I can't, I don't care too much either". I expressed a deep sigh of utter pain and 
walked out. The reader probably knows already what the $80,000 student loan for a 23 year old medical student in 
today's times means and what it actually entails for the next 20 years. The essence is, the once pious world of 
education was attacked by a virus, and the virus wore suits and the objective of that virus was to make 
money(even more money, at an ever increasing rate) without any other concern whatsoever - we are a capitalistic world 
after all, remember?

## New Italian Suits

Italian suits are good, I have one(however, they are totally inapplicable for the Indian climate, I live and work in 
India) and nothing wrong with them. But I guess you get my drift. The education and learning business constantly 
re-invented itself, made possible by the brightest MBA's all over the world ever ready to go for the kill. In the long, 
cold, stone walled corridors of modern businesses and corporations, it was decided that, we need to deliver learning 
through new digital media. Excellent! That's awesome, so much greenhouse gas can be thus eliminated. I am all in for 
that. This is awesome. Now even someone in the remotest part of the world can get access to quality education easily 
and in an affordable way - all made possible by the power of Digital. It can't get any better. However a strange thing 
happened. This noble thought and innovative way of making education accessible and cheap, gave way to something else. 
Next section please.

## Technology, Corporations, Individuals and Open Source

Let's take a step back. Give me five more minutes please. Let's now shift our focus to a specific domain, the technology domain. More specifically, the information technology/software domain. This domain is unique in many ways. Technologies, software and frameworks are created at a whirlwind pace today. There are so many wonderful intellectuals, coders, and common people who create marvelous pieces of software that have the capacity to change the world. The world will always remember Open Source and Linus Torvalds - I am not associated with Linus in any way. Modern and large technology corporations are doing their bit by constantly inventing technology that have the power to change the world. They thus need to be thanked for the effort they are taking. So far so good. Life is good, and everybody did their part - hopefully in the right earnest.

## People Need Jobs

Millions of knowledge workers are needing jobs, technology jobs. They apply for jobs, get hired. They apply again for a next job and get hired and so on. The technology market (driven by business needs) is so crowded, that if I don't know the latest and greatest tech, the current lingo, we can't get an interview, forget about getting a job. Even if one knows the tech, the latest and greatest, chances are you won't get a job. You need something else.

## A Piece of Paper - With a Stamp of Approval - From the Guy with a Tie

Hmmm, I guess I am reaching towards the closing part of my article now. The world seeks validation, the world needs validation. The graduate was given a piece of paper when he/she graduated from the university. That was a necessary document. It was issued by a University, bound by solemn oath to do good for the society. It's another matter altogether whether the true value of education was imparted or not. Life has come full circle for the graduate again. Today, he/she needs a piece of paper again, a certificate, issued by someone who I trust(blindly??? arghhh..) that says, I am skilled in a certain technology or competency or a cloud/technology service sold by a large technology company. That piece of paper is issued through the familiar process called certification. Ummmm, sounds fair enough. That would kind of serve the same purpose the graduate's degree served, right? Well, there's the interesting part and the conclusion of my article.

## Why? Why on God's Green Earth?

Money is a piece of paper. It can give someone food, health and power. It can kill billions, it can do every conceivable form of bad and good as well. Money is a scarce resource, it should be conserved(no, all of a sudden I have not become anti-business and I don't need a Harvard degree to understand micro and macro economics - common sense prevails again). Just like money, time is scare. Time should be invested in my opinion to do good for ourselves and good for others in a meaningful and sustainable way. Time spent in doing something to fill the coffers of the Italian suit guy(suit or no suit does not matter) in exchange of a piece of paper is something I personally am not able to comprehend fully - I have fairly average IQ, but I can guarantee I am not dumb. "So, what are you saying Arun? Are you saying, no one should do certifications after all?". I ain't saying nothing. I would let the reader answer that question for themselves and do whatever is best for them. I am no one to put words in anyone's mouth. I am neither a sorcerer, nor a paid columnist, nor Steve Jobs adept at creating a "reality distortion field". I am a common and humble human being fueled by the desire to pursue truth, do the right thing and spread awareness - that is both my dharma and karma.

## So What Should One Do? How to get a Job after all?

"Ok, ok, ok, Arun, I heard you. You are not totally insane but not making full sense either. Please tell me how to get a job and who is going to believe that I have actually acquired these ten skills which the employer is looking for. Tell me how do I prove my credibility to the employer". Creativity my friend! And while being creative, also do a ton of good to humanity. Be smart, save money, change the world. "Come again?". Go ahead and start an open source project, or better even join an open source project. Contribute with your best possible capacity. Let your name show up in the release notes. The entire world will see, what you know, what you did and what everybody in the community thinks about you - your open source project had probably the wisest, nicest and most civilized guys bound by extremely high code of conduct. Let your work validate your skills and your credibility, which is probably without doubt, a far more convincing medium than a piece of paper. Sounds good? "What else?", Head over to the developer boards, answer as many questions as you can. People will see you, know you and thank you. You will be doing your bit to change the world. "But I don't have the skills to start with, and that's the original intent of certification". You can still learn, and actually not pay the guy with the tie. You can learn great coding skills and specific technologies by looking at great code. Just ask for help, even if you are a rookie, people will point you in the right direction - that's the code of conduct that Open Source is bound by. "And what about technology sold by large technology companies and tech that is proprietary? They say that the training and certification is only available from their learning portal" My friend, spend a good weekend going through the docs. 90% of tech today (tech that actually matters) is open source and rarely one charges to read their documentation - at a maximum they will ask you to create an user ID on their platform. Go ahead and try, learn it, by doing it. Create something fresh, collaborate with someone and give back to the world. You will get hired, because the employer is smart - usually much smarter than the job seeker.

## Conclusion

It's not about the hurdles. They will always be there. It's all about the intent. If the intent is to do good to ourselves and to others in a meaningful and sustainable way, we will always do the right thing, and we ourselves will find out innovative ways to do our bit of good.
