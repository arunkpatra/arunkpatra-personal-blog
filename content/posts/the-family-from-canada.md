AS MY stay here at California nears its end, I find myself some time at my disposal to just sit back and look back for a while. I met a very wide array of people here, mostly at the Vikings bar where all these oldie bikers show up. Its an old school American bar, and people are friendly. Some master pool players show up sometimes, and my friend Benjamin helped me pick up the basics of the game. So, everyone over here has a story to tell, eager to share something and then they buy me a drink. Good fellas...

I have a little story as well to tell. A couple of months after I landed over here, I happened to meet a Canadian family. Well, a Canadian Geese family. There were two of them and they are huge birds. They migrated from Canada to California and made the sprawling grounds and the artificial lake near my work area as their new summer home. Long timers over here at work tell me that Canadian Geese haven't shown up at our office grounds since the last very many years and it was a matter of great excitement for everyone to have them around here once again.

So here they were, happily roaming around the grounds and its a treat to watch them from a distance. I usually grab a coffee every morning and walk over to the grounds to watch them for a while. One fine morning, they were nowhere to be seen. I went over almost to the edge of the grounds to the foothills to see if they are around. Still I couldn't find them. Probably they just didn't like the place. Probably they just took off to some other place...

Weeks passed by, and I forgot them for a while. Then all of a sudden one morning they were back! And along with them were seven small fat goslings! Oh what a feeling it was to see them back again! And everyone around was so happy about it. For days altogether all our meetings used to start with a brief discussion on the Canadian Geese family. I even did some research and found out the reason as why they were not to be seen for those few weeks. When they incubate the eggs, the parents rarely go out and far from the nest. People told me it was rare to see such large Canadian Geese from the wild to see in California. We were so lucky to have them around. Those geese are very protective about their kids and at least one parent is on the lookout for any possible danger all the time.

I had taken my coffee that day, just like any other day at work and walked over to the grounds to see the geese family. What I saw instead shook me. Instead of the entire family, there was just a single parent and a single gosling to be seen. There were no signs of the rest. I frantically tried to look for them all over the place. But after a short while I had to accept the truth. They were probably eaten up by the coyotes or the raccoons who come down from the other side of the hill at night to hunt. With a heavy heart, i went back to work and spent a disturbed day. Complex thoughts about birth, life, death and our existence kept floating around my head all day and that night. Neither did I talk to anyone that day nor did I do much...

Although I didn't feel like taking my coffee to the grounds the next day, I kind of involuntarily walked out of door towards the ground. That morning, I didn't find the remaining goose and the gosling. The kind hearted security guard told me that there were feathers all over the place that morning at the back. And she told me another thing which i had expected the least. 'Don't love anyone so much - it hurts when you loose them' she said, smiled and went away. My head started to spin and it lasted a while. And I never went back to the same grounds after that.

Today morning however, I went over there again and took some pictures of the place where I had spent so many happy mornings. So I guess then, I will never forget the kind lady at the security gate i met that day. I did think over what she had said for a few days. And I believe she was probably right. Complex and intense feelings like love, expectation or affection are things that are not made for everyone. They are not for the faint hearted. They are designs for the human mind specifically created by God only for those who can handle it. Its like an extremely potent drug, and unless you can handle it and digest it, you will die of overdose. It does good only to those who balance it out with other things in life. It works out only when its taken in moderation and only when the inner self monitors the use...

I have always maintained that, at the bottom of all human miseries are two things - expectation and insecurity. Much can I say on those but some other day. All that suffices to say at this juncture is that expectation makes you weak, and weakness makes you insecure. Insecurity is a disease which is extremely difficult to cure. If left untreated it would take fatal forms like suspicion, jealousy, anger, vengeance and the like. Death follows soon thereafter. Not from outside but from inside. What is left then is a walking corpse. You see many of them crossing the street, every day... little do we realize that tomorrow we could be one of them...
